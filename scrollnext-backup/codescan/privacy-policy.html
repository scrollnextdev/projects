  <li class="c1"><span class="c8">Visiting www.codescan.io</span></li>
  <li class="c1"><span class="c8">Accessing your Account and following the instructions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable

    cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to
    you. </span></p>
    <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
    <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
    <h5><i><b>Response Timing and Format</b></i></h5>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<h6 class="text-center">Non-Discrimination</h6>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<ul class="ml-5">
  <li class="c1"><span class="c8">Deny you goods or services.</span></li>

  <li class="c1"><span class="c8">Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or
          a different level or quality of goods or services.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
